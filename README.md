# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic – Machine Learning Model
- This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built for the Kaggle Spaceship Titanic dataset.
- It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension after the Spaceship Titanic incident, using various passenger and travel-related features.

## ✨ Features
- 📂 Data Loading — Load training and test datasets from Kaggle
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Analyze distributions, correlations, and missing values
- 🛠 Feature Engineering — Handle missing data, split compound columns, encode categorical features, and scale numeric features
- 🤖 Model Training — Apply and tune machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- 📊 Model Evaluation — Use accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance
- 📉 Visualization — Generate informative plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 📦 Requirements
Install the required Python packages before running the notebook:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```


## 📚 Workflow
- Data Preprocessing
- Load CSV files into Pandas DataFrames
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features
- Model Training
- Train and compare ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
